Ever wondered where your arrow, snowball, or potion will land? This mod gives you a visual preview of projectile trajectories and highlights the target impact zone—perfect for planning shots with precision.

Latest version can be downloaded on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ptp)

## 🔎 Features

- Trajectory Visualization: See the path your projectile will follow before you launch it.
- Target Highlighting: Know exactly where your shot is likely to land.
- Customizable Display: Tailor the look of the trajectory line, target outline, and highlight to suit your style.

## ⚙️ Configuration

To edit the settings of the mod:
- Use Mod Menu
- Use commands `/ptpConfig setting value`
- Edit the config file in `.minecraft/config/ptp.json`


## ⚠️ Limitations and notes

- Minecraft Projectiles often have a random offset, so the actual impact may sometime differs a bit from the preview.
- Water and lava may interfere with trajectory accuracy, fluid support is a work in progress.
- Modded items are not supported. If you want compatibility with a specific mod, open an issue on Github and suggest it, I'll do my best to add it.

## 🛑 Usage on servers 

This mod doesn't work on servers to prevent using it as a cheat in PVP. If you want to have it on your custom servers, you still can, just install the mod on both, the client and the server.

## 📦 Modpack

Feel free to add this mod in your modpacks.
